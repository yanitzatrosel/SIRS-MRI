# SIRS-MRI

## Background theory

Stimulus-Induced Rotary Saturation (SIRS) is a potential method to directly measure neuronal current.

## Pulse program

Notes:

x = 0 = $0^\circ$ \\
y = 1 = $90^\circ$ \\
-x = 2 = $180^\circ$ \\
-y = 3 = $270^\circ$ \\

The pulse sequence of SIRS starts a relaxation delay d1 to let the magnetization reach equillibrium in z-direction. Then a hard  pulse (p1) is applied $\pi/2$ in x direction. Followed by a phase-shifted spin-lock (SL) with amplitude $B_{s1}$. TSL corresponds to the duration time for the SL pulse. TSL depends on the T2 value for the tissue of interest (NOTE for myself: check value for brain tissue).
